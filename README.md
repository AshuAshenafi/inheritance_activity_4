#Classes Software and Book are made to be final
When used in a class declaration, the final keyword means a class can't be inherited. In doing this as a guarantee that 
the code in the class could never be overridden. This ensures other programmers won't extend the beautiful class. 
Final provides a safety net from a future of lesser programmers raising havoc on the future of the company.

Save the company by converting the Book and Software 
subclasses to final classes. The future is waiting.
